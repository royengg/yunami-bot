# 🎭 Yunami: The Multiplayer Role-Playing Bot

**Turn your Discord server into a living story.**

Yunami is not just a text game—it's a shared cinematic experience. You and your friends take on unique roles (like *The Detective*, *The Criminal*, or *The Scholar*) and play through interactive stories where everyone sees the same screen, but **everyone has different secrets.**

## 🔥 Features that Make it Special

### 🕵️‍♀️ True Role-Playing
You aren't just voting on options. You **are** your character.
- **The Detective** sees clues others miss.
- **The Criminal** can take illegal actions (that only they can see!).
- **The Scholar** deciphers ancient texts.

### 🤫 Secret Information
While everyone looks at the main story in the channel, Yunami sends **private DMs** to specific players.
> *"You notice the Detective is lying. Do you call them out?"*

### 📺 Shared Screen Experience
No more scrolling up and down. The story happens in **one single, updating message**. It feels like watching a movie together, but you control the plot.

### ⏱️ High-Stakes Moments
- **Timed Decisions:** The bomb is ticking. Vote now or explode.
- **Split Missions:** The party splits up! Team A goes to the woods, Team B investigates the basement. You'll have to trust that they survived...
