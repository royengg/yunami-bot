# 🎭 Yunami: The Multiplayer Role-Playing Bot

**Your portal to interactive storytelling and anime-inspired adventures.**

Yunami is a story telling-interactive game bot that turns your Discord server into a stage. Whether you're solving a gritty noir mystery, battling in a fantasy isekai, or living out a slice-of-life drama, the story changes based on **who you are** and **what you choose**.

It's not just a text game—it's a shared cinematic experience where you and your friends play unique characters (from Anime archetypes to hardened detectives) and shape the narrative together.

## 🔥 Features that Make it Special

### 🌍 A Multiverse of Stories
Yunami isn't just one game. It's an engine for *many* worlds.
- **Mystery**: Solve cold cases where every player has a secret motive.
- **Anime Battles**: Team up with classic archetypes (The Berserker, The Shadow, The Seeker) to fight bosses.
- **Survival**: Split up to scavenge resources, hoping you all make it back.

### 🕵️‍♀️ True Role-Playing
You aren't just voting on options. You **are** your character.
- **The Berserker** might have the option to *Kick Down the Door*.
- **The Scholar** might have the option to *Decipher the Runes*.
- **The Shadow** might see shortcuts that no one else can see.

### 🤫 Secret Information
While everyone looks at the main story in the channel, Yunami sends **private DMs** to specific players.
> *"You notice the party leader is hiding a bite mark. Do you call them out?"*

### 📺 Shared Screen Experience
No more scrolling up and down. The story happens in **one single, updating message**. It feels like watching a movie together, but you control the plot.
